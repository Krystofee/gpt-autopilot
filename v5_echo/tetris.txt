I want to create instructions for building a program. This program will be a tetris. It should use pygame.

- It should have standard tetris blocks and game board size.
- It should compute score properly and should erase the row and add score.
- If it reaches top, it should stop and print score to the terminal.
- Show score at the top left.
- Tiles should be colored.
- Ot should be controlled using wasd, where a moves left, d moves right and ws rotates the piece.
- It should run at slow speed, 2 frames per second.

- It can use dependencies, but dont include dependencies installation in the tasks, just add them to requirements.txt, dont include version
- Your job is to create set of tasks to distribute the work in smaller pieces to separate independent coder tasks.
- Dont include any tasks about setup environment and file creation just write filename which should be used, that is handled differently, just focus on the code and logic.
- You can import the files that are in the project from other files.
- It should be runnable from main.py, make the main.py in the last task.
