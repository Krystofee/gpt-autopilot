I want to create instructions for building a program.

- Your job is to create a fastapi server. It will fetch an external API using requests, process the request and return the result in the response.
- The api key is: V7MX5QSVQ0LT7LSJ, store it in .env, load it in program using python-dotenv dependency
- use this API https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=IBM&interval=5min&apikey=V7MX5QSVQ0LT7LSJ
- this returns:
{
    "Meta Data": {
        "1. Information": "Intraday (5min) open, high, low, close prices and volume",
        "2. Symbol": "IBM",
        "3. Last Refreshed": "2024-05-17 19:55:00",
        "4. Interval": "5min",
        "5. Output Size": "Compact",
        "6. Time Zone": "US/Eastern"
    },
    "Time Series (5min)": {
        "2024-05-17 19:55:00": {
            "1. open": "169.0190",
            "2. high": "169.0190",
            "3. low": "169.0190",
            "4. close": "169.0190",
            "5. volume": "1"
        },
        "2024-05-17 19:50:00": {
            "1. open": "168.9800",
            "2. high": "168.9800",
            "3. low": "168.9700",
            "4. close": "168.9700",
            "5. volume": "156"
        },
        "2024-05-17 19:45:00": {
            "1. open": "169.0100",
            "2. high": "169.0300",
            "3. low": "168.9700",
            "4. close": "168.9700",
            "5. volume": "57"
        },
        ...
- Return this just the time series in the response.

- Dont use subfolders as filenames.
- It can use dependencies, but dont include dependencies installation in the tasks, just add them to requirements.txt, dont include version
- Your job is to create set of tasks to distribute the work in smaller pieces to separate independent coder tasks.
- Dont include any tasks about setup environment and file creation just write filename which should be used, that is handled differently, just focus on the code and logic.
- You can import the files that are in the project from other files.
- It should be runnable from main.py, make the main.py in the last task.
