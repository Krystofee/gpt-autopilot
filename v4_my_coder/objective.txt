This project involves creating a classic "Snake" game that runs directly in the terminal. The game will be controlled using the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys for movement. The objective of the game is to maneuver the snake to eat items that appear randomly on the screen, causing the snake to grow in length. Each item eaten increases the player's score. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the edges of the terminal.

Everything should be in main.py. Use the pygame library. I also want a simple main menu to start the game and to display the score.
